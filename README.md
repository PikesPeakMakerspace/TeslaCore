# TESLA API

This is a small project being used to prototype a Python REST API for a larger volunteer project. I haven't used Python all that much, especially in a web server scenario. Let's fix that here.

### For Memory and Further Documentation:

```
#ubuntu (python3 already installed in ubuntu 22.x?)
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
